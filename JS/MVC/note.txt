What's MVC?

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. It is a design pattern used to create a flexible and maintainable architecture for software applications.

The MVC pattern separates the application into three interconnected components:

Model: The model represents the data and the business logic of the application. 
It is responsible for managing the data and performing any necessary calculations or operations on it.

MVC Pros and cons

Pros:
1. Separation of concerns: The MVC pattern separates the application into three distinct components, 
   making it easier to manage and maintain the code.
2. Flexibility: The MVC pattern allows for easy modification and extension of the application, 
   as changes can be made to the model, view, or controller without affecting the other components.

Cons:
1. Complexity: The MVC pattern can add complexity to the application, 
   as it requires additional code to manage the communication between the components.
2. Overhead: The MVC pattern may introduce additional overhead, 
   as it requires more components to be created and managed.

MVC is a popular design pattern used in web development to create scalable and maintainable applications. 
It separates the application into three interconnected components, making it easier to manage and maintain the code.


JSON:
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, 
and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is often used to transmit data between a web server and a web client, 
such as a web browser or a mobile application.

JSON is a text-based format that is similar to JavaScript objects and arrays. It uses key-value pairs to represent data, 
with keys in double quotes and values in single quotes. For example, the following JSON object represents a person:

File System Node:

A file system node is a fundamental unit of a file system that represents a file or a directory. 
It is a data structure that contains information about the file or directory, such as its name, 
location, size, and permissions. File system nodes are used to organize and manage files and directories in a file system.

File System Node in MVC:

In the context of MVC, a file system node can be used to represent a model. 
A model in MVC is a representation of the data that the application is working with, 
and it is responsible for managing the data and providing it to the view and controller.
