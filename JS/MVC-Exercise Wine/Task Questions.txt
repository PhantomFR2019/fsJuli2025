Task Objectives

1. Implement the wines command.

Make coding in order to show the list of wines in the shelves.
ex:

        // node index.js wines
        output:
        Welcome to Wine Management!!
        1. Moscato 2010
        2. White Bourdon

2. Implement the add command.

Make coding in order to add a new wine to the shelves.
ex:

        // node index.js add "Red Caliber/2015/R"
        output:
        Welcome to Wine Management!!
        "Red Caliber has been added!"

    <wine_name> format --> "Red Caliber/2015/R"
    its a string and it has 3 parts:
    1. Name of the wine
    2. Year of the wine
    3. Type of the wine

    Type of wine:
    1. R - Red
    2. W - White
    Besides of R / W it will be made to O - Other.

3. Implement the sell command.

Make coding in order to delete a wine from the shelves.
ex:

        // node index.js sell <"Red Caliber">
        output:
        Welcome to Wine Management!!
        "Red Caliber" has been sold!

4. Implement the rename command.

Make coding in order to rename a wine from the shelves.
ex:

        // node index.js rename 3 "White Caliber" <wine_id> <wine_name>


        output:
        Welcome to Wine Management!!
        "Red Caliber" has been renamed to "White Caliber"

        // if not found
        Id is not found!


5. Implement findByid command.

node index.js findById 1

// output
Moscato 2010 is Red Wine with age of 10 years.

// if not found
Id is not found!



=================================
Task 2 (advance practice)

add more features to the program:

1. to group the wine by type (R, W, O) - with group <wine_type>
2. to sort the wine by their age (Ascending / Descending)

ex:

node index.js group <wine_type>
node index.js age ascending
